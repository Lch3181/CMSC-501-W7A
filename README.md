1. Write an interactive program for customers of Yummy’s Ice Cream Sundaes which:  

    Allow customers the option of choosing a three-scoop, two-scoop, or one-scoop creation at a base price of $11.00, $8.00, or $4.50, respectively. Let the customer choose chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla as the primary flavor. If the customer adds nuts, whipped cream, or cherries to the order, add $0.75 for each to the base price. After the customer finishes, display the price of the order.  

2. Design the storyboards, interactivity diagram, object dictionary, and any necessary scripts for an interactive program that allows a user to play a card game named Lucky Seven. In real life, the game can be played with seven cards, each containing a number from 1 through 7, that are shuffled and dealt number-side down. To start the game, a player turns over any card. The exposed number on the card determines the position (reading from left to right) of the next card that must be turned over. For example, if the player turns over the first card and its number is 7, the next card turned must be the seventh card (counting from left to right). If the player turns over a card whose number denotes a position that was already turned, the player loses the game. If the player succeeds in turning over all seven cards, the player wins.  

    Instead of cards, you will use seven buttons labeled 1 through 7 from left to right. Randomly associate one of the seven values 1 through 7 with each button. (In other words, the associated value might or might not be equivalent to the button’s labeled value.) When the player clicks a button, reveal the associated hidden value. If the value represents the position of a button already clicked, the player loses. If the revealed number represents an available button, force the user to click it—that is, do not take any action until the user clicks the correct button. After a player clicks a button, remove the button from play.  

    For example, a player might click Button 7, revealing a 4. Then the player clicks Button 4, revealing a 2. Then the player clicks Button 2, revealing a 7. The player loses because Button 7 is already “used.”  

3. Design the storyboards, interactivity diagram, object dictionary, and any necessary scripts for an interactive program for customers of the Dharma Day Spa. Allow customers the option of choosing a manicure ($15), pedicure ($30), or both ($38). After the customer clicks a Select button, display the price of the service.
